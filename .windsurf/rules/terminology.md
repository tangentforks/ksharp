K sometimes differs from the traditional terminology used in other languages and it is extremely important to take these differences into consideration when using traditional sources as a reference. 

E.g. 

- "symbol" in K is always a data type. When referring to non-alphanumeric characters such as + - * % we will wuse the word "glyph"
- "%" means "divide" (because it is the ASCII glyph that most resembles ÷)
- Glyphs different from "%" never mean "divide"
- dyadic "!" with atomic (scalar) arguments means "modulo"
- Glyphs different from "!" never mean "modulo"
- "/" means "over" (and it is an adverb, not a verb) unless it is preceded by a space
- "/" preceded by a space is a comment marker
- dyadic "!" with a vector second arguments means "rotate"
- _sv _vs _dv and _di have the meanings in K of "scalar from vector" "vector from scalar" "delete value" and "delete item"

This code was written with extensive assistance from AI, more specifically SWE-1.5

In the absence of legislation to the contrary, I will claim that AI is merely a tool and I am entitled to the copyright of this work.
I consider the process of AI code generation that translates natural language into code to be substantially similar to the process of using a compiler to translate a high-level computer language into low-level machine code.
A well-established industry standard is for the author of the high-level code to claim copyright over the output produced by a compiler and by analogy I claim copyright over the output produced by AI.

My current plan is to release this software under a more permissive license when it is more mature.
If you wish to use this code before then, please contact me (there is a good chance I'll simply license it for your use).
